# Lagos-Community-College-Chat
The **Lagos Community College Chat Application** is an end-to-end chat app built with the websocket using the Javascript Socket IO library. It enables smooth, fast and easy communication between students over a period of time.

No external databases, so the chat history is temporary and clears on web browser page reload.
